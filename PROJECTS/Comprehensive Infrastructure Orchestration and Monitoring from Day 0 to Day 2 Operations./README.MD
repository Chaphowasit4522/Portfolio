# Technologies & Tools
**Kubernetes**: Kubernetes was chosen as the primary container orchestration platform to automate deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It forms the foundational layer for efficient infrastructure orchestration.

**Ansible**: Ansible serves as the automation tool for configuration management, streamlining tasks and processes across the infrastructure. Its role is crucial in ensuring efficient and automated workflows.

**Zabbix**: Zabbix, an enterprise-class open-source monitoring solution, is implemented to provide comprehensive monitoring capabilities for the infrastructure. It ensures real-time insights into system health and performance.

**Grafana**: Grafana, an open-source monitoring and observability platform, is employed for visualizing data from various sources. It enhances the understanding of infrastructure performance through interactive and customizable dashboards.

**Filebeat**: Filebeat, a lightweight log shipper, is utilized to forward and centralize log data. Its role is crucial in facilitating log data collection for enhanced monitoring and analysis.

#### **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana):

**Elasticsearch**: Distributed search and analytics engine, employed for efficient data retrieval and analysis.
**Logstash**: Server-side data processing pipeline, ensuring the smooth flow of data for comprehensive log analysis.
**Kibana**: Analytics and visualization platform, providing rich insights into log data through interactive visualizations.
